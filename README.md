FIFA 22 is a football simulation video game developed by EA Vancouver as part of Electronic Arts' FIFA series. FIFA 22 contains a rich dataset with plenty of attributes covering all aspects of a real-life footballer in an attempt to immitate him as much as possible in the virtual world. This rich dataset provides a huge oppurtunity for us, data scientists or data analysts to analyze and come up with visualizations and patterns. I will try to cover the following:

The dataset distribution based on player nationality, player overall rating, age vs overall rating, player valuation and so on.
The patterns in the dataset
Top football playing Countries, Top Clubs, Top players and so on.
